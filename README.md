# Predictype: TypeScript Predicates for Productivity

Predictype is a modern, type-safe predicate library for TypeScript. It provides a comprehensive set of reusable predicate functions for validating values, building expressive filters, and composing complex logic for arrays and objects.

Its goal: make working with predicates and validation as productive and reliable as possible, with full type safety and a clean, extensible API.

## Features

- **Rich predicate collection**: Includes predicates for arrays, numbers, strings, dates, booleans, objects, and more.
- **Type-safe and composable**: All predicates are fully typed and can be composed to build complex validation or filtering logic.
- **Reusable**: Use predicates for validation, filtering arrays, or as building blocks in your own libraries.
- **Consistent API**: Unified naming and signatures for all predicates.
- **Ready for functional programming**: All predicates are pure functions and can be used with array methods like `filter`, `every`, `some`, etc.
